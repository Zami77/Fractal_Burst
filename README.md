# Fractal Burst
Fractals are repeating patterns, often found throughout nature. Time is one. Follow Isaac and his android partner in attempting to alter the neverending fractal of time.

Fractal Burst was created for the 6th Anuual Driftwood Gaming Jam and is my first attempt at game development. I chose the themes
- Not what it seems
- Time Travel
- Babies (You'll understand by the end)

I had a lot of fun making this game, from writing the story and dialogue to creating the soundtrack. RPG Maker MZ is a nifty little engine and I appreciate how fast it let me get a game up and running. The plugin system is also great, and I enjoyed writing some custom JS code (The major one being the four corner battle screen [Check here for my plugin](https://github.com/Zami77/RPG_Maker_MZ_Plugins/tree/main/FourCornersBattleScreen)). Future endeavors I may branch out to game engines like Unity or the Unreal engine, but for now I'm happy with RPG Maker MZ.

The game was designed to be completed in under 30 minutes, and will most likely clock in at about 20 minutes. At the bottom of this readme is a guide to get you through the puzzles and some combat strategy, if you need it.
