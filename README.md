# Fractal Burst
Fractals are repeating patterns, often found throughout nature. Time is one. Follow Isaac and his android partner in attempting to alter the neverending fractal of time.

Fractal Burst was created for the 6th Anuual Driftwood Gaming Jam and is my first attempt at game development. I chose the themes
- Not what it seems
- Time Travel
- Babies (You'll understand by the end)

The game was designed to be completed in under 30 minutes, and will most likely clock in at about 20 minutes. At the bottom of this readme is a guide to get you through the puzzles and some combat strategy.
